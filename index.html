            Numerous studies have shown that a variety of teas may boost your immune system,
             fight off inflammation, and even ward off cancer and heart disease. 
             While some brews provide more health advantages than others, 
             there's plenty of evidence that regularly drinking tea can have a lasting impact on your wellness.
